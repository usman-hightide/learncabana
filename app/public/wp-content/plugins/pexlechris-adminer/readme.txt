Manage the database from your WordPress Dashboard using Adminer.

== Description ==

The best database management tool for the best CMS.

This plugin uses the tool [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/), in order to give database access to administrators directly from the Dashboard.
As simple as the previous sentence!

I am not the author of Adminer. I am only the author who does the WordPress integration with Adminer.
Author of Adminer is Jakub Vrana and you can donate him from [there](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?item_name=Donation+to+Adminer&cmd=_donations&business=jakub%40vrana.cz).

Compatible also with WordPress Multisite installations


== WP Adminer access positions ==
You can access the WP Adminer from the below positions:
1. WP Adminer URL in the Admin Bar
2. WP Adminer Tools Page (Dashboard > Tools > WP Adminer)

== Explore my other plugins ==
* [Library Viewer](https://www.pexlechris.dev/library-viewer/wp-wpadminer): With Library Viewer, you can display the containing files and the containing folders of a “specific folder” of your (FTP) server to your users in the front-end.
* [Gift Wrapping for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gift-wrapping-for-woocommerce): This plugin allows customers to select a gift wrapper for their orders, via a checkbox in the checkout page.


== Screenshots ==

1. The WP Adminer opened from Admin Bar
2. The new dropdown admin_bar items

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

 = Is it safe? =
 Yes, because only administrators have access to WP Adminer. If a guest tries to access the WP Adminer URL, a 404 page will be shown up.


 = Who has access to WP Adminer? =
&nbsp;

 * In the case of single site WordPress installations, only Administrators have access in WP Adminer, because by default only administrator have the `manage_options` capability.
 * In the case of WordPress Multisite installations, only Super Admins have access in WP Adminer, because by default only Super Admins have the `manage_network_options` capability.
 * In all cases, the `manage_wp_adminer` capability now (versions **4.3.0** and above) grants access to WP Adminer. You can assign this capability to a role via code or through the User Role Editor plugin.

 = How to allow other capabilities or roles to have access to WP Adminer? =
 Just use the filter `pexlechris_adminer_access_capabilities` and return the array of desired capabilities that you want to have access to WP Adminer.
 For roles, just use the corresponding capabilities, while checking against particular roles in place of a capability is supported in part, this practice is discouraged as it may produce unreliable results.


 = WP Adminer is stuck in an endless loop, constantly refreshing the page without stopping. What is the issue? =
 This issue maybe is due to the caching engine that your browser OR server uses!
 * You can try to whitelist the WP Adminer URL, OR
 * You can change the WP Adminer URL to a URL that is already whitelisted. For example:
 `define( 'PEXLECHRIS_ADMINER_SLUG', 'wp-admin/adminer');`


 = How to add my own JS and/or CSS in adminer head? =
 You need to use action `pexlechris_adminer_head` as follows:
 `
 add_action('pexlechris_adminer_head', function(){
    // Use the appropriate get_nonce() function based on your WP Adminer version
    $nonce = function_exists('Adminer\get_nonce')
        ? Adminer\get_nonce() // For WP Adminer v4.0.0 and newer
        : get_nonce(); // For WP Adminer versions below 4.0.0
    ?>
    <script nonce="<?php echo esc_attr( $nonce )?>"> // get_nonce is an adminer function
       // Place your JS code here
    </script>
    <style>
       /* Place your CSS code here */
    </style>
    <?php
 });
 `

 = How can I change the WP Adminer children items at the admin bar? =
 You can do this using WP filter: `pexlechris_adminer_adminbar_dropdown_items`.
 Filter's PHPDoc:
 `
/**
 * The dropdown items.
 *
 * @param array $dropdown_items{
 *      @type string $name. The table name.
 *      @type string $label. The label of the dropdown item.
 *      @type array $args. The array of extra url parameters. Parameters will not be encoded.
 *                         Developers could avoid defining args in the array
 * }
 */
$dropdown_items = apply_filters('pexlechris_adminer_adminbar_dropdown_items', $dropdown_items);
 `


 = How can I add other Adminer plugins or Adminer extensions? =
 In Adminer's website there is documentation about [Adminer plugins](https://www.adminer.org/en/plugins/) and [Adminer extensions](https://www.adminer.org/en/extension/).
 In order to define function adminer_object() before this plugin define it, you need to define it inside the hook `pexlechris_adminer_before_adminer_loads`.
 More in the phpDoc below:
 `
/**
 * adminer_object can be overridden, in WP action pexlechris_adminer_before_adminer_loads.
 * If a developer want to make his/her own changes (adding plugins, extensions or customizations),
 * it is strongly recommended to include_once the class Pexlechris_Adminer and extend it and
 * make adminer_object function return his/her new class.
 *
 * It is strongly recommended, because Pexlechris_Adminer class contains WordPress/Adminer integration (auto login with WordPress credentials)
 *
 * If a developer want to add just JS and/or CSS in head, he/she can just use the action pexlechris_adminer_head.
 * See plugin's FAQs, for more.

 = Can I limit access to some table/DB ? =
 The answer in this question is complicated.
 The best solution is to create a Database User with the appropriate privileges.
 Maybe you can do it also with WordPress actions.
 Read more in [this support ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/limit-access-to-some-table-db/).


 = How can I access other databases in the same server and same database user? =
 By default, you haven't access to any database other than the site's database. In order to enable access, you need to add the following line code `define('PEXLECHRIS_ADMINER_HAVE_ACCESS_ONLY_IN_WP_DB', false);` in the wp-config.php file.


 = Why is Adminer better than phpMyAdmin? =
 Replace **phpMyAdmin** with **Adminer** and you will get a tidier user interface, better support for MySQL features, higher performance and more security. [See detailed comparison](https://www.adminer.org/en/phpmyadmin/).
 Adminer development priorities are: 1. Security, 2. User experience, 3. Performance, 4. Feature set, 5. Size.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin from [Official WP Plugin Repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pexlechris-adminer/)
2. Upload Plugin from your WP Dashboard ( Plugins > Add New > Upload Plugin ) the pexlechris-adminer.zip file.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress Dashboard

  > If you're extending my class `Pexlechris_Adminer`, everything will continue to work fine!
  > However, if you’ve used `get_nonce()` to include custom JavaScript, you **must** update it to `Adminer\get_nonce()`.
    For more details, check the FAQ: “**How to add my own JS and/or CSS in Adminer head?**”
* [New]: New Adminer version 5.1.1! Update from original [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/en/).
  The previously used AdminerEVO fork is no longer maintained and has been discontinued. It has now been replaced with the default Adminer (v5.1.1).
* [New]: New function `get_pexlechris_adminer_url()`. Can be filtered by new below hook:
* [New]: New filter `pexlechris_adminer_url` that change the returned value of function `get_pexlechris_adminer_url()`.

* Fix bug that produced when the plugin has been deactivated but the relevant MU plugin has not been deleted. Thanks [peopleinside](https://wordpress.org/support/users/peopleinside/) for reporting

 = 3.0.2 =
* Change name from `Database Management tool - Adminer` to `Adminer for WP - The Database Management tool`
* Add an `Open WP Adminer` link in plugin's action links
* Improved Deactivation Behavior: Deactivating the plugin now removes the `pexlechris_adminer_mu_plugin_version option`, ensuring the MU plugin is reinstalled upon reactivation.

 = 3.0.1 =
* Fixes the bug introduced in version 3.0.0, where a disabled plugin named **pexlechris_adminer_avoid_conflicts_with_other_plugins.php** was displayed in the list of plugins.

 = 3.0.0 =
* New Adminer Version Included: Updated to 4.8.4, forked from the original Adminer 4.8.1 due to lack of maintenance for over two years.
  Learn more about the fork and updates at [AdminerEVO Website](https://docs.adminerevo.org/#history).
* Tested up to PHP: 8.2
* Tested up to WP: 6.7.1
* From version 2.2.0 there is a must-use plugin, that disables on the fly all other plugins to avoid conflicts.
    From now and then the version and the mu plugins updates is controlled by option pexlechris_adminer_mu_plugin_version.
    You can delete the option to reinstall it, or set option to 0 to ignore version updates forever
* Fix load_plugin_textdomain file path and current language
* Fix Notice "Function _load_textdomain_just_in_time was called incorrectly" in WP 6.7.0 and above

 = 2.2.2 =
* Before version 2.2, if PEXLECHRIS_ADMINER_SLUG ends with a slash, WP Adminer was not working.

 = 2.2.1 =
* From now on, this plugin requires WordPress version at least 4.7.0 or later. According to Wordfence, versions below 4.7.0 have a vulnerability that can allow site takeover.

 = 2.2.0 =
* Tested up to 6.4.2
* SOS: From now when WP Adminer runs, only WP Adminer plugin is running (a must-use plugin is automatically installed and is being deleted on plugin deactivation).
So the only way to extend WP Adminer plugin's functionalities using wp hooks is using a must-use plugin.
