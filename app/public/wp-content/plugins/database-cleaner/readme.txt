== Why another Database Cleaner? ==

While other database cleaners are available, my experience with them revealed areas for improvement, like outdated UIs, incomplete features, and limited data analysis capabilities. Most notably, they struggled with large databases. Motivated by these challenges, I developed my own solution. Now, I'm dedicated to refining it to suit all types of WordPress and databases, aiming to make it the best for everyone.

I'm open to feedback and would be thrilled to discuss how Database Cleaner can better meet your needs. Let's chat and enhance this tool together!

1. Upload the plugin to WordPress.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Meow Apps -> Database Cleaner in the sidebar and check the appropriate options.
